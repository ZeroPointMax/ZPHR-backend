# ZeroPointHifiRemote-backend

Android Client for ZeroPointHifiRemote (ZPHR).

Bring new life into your old HiFi by retrofitting it into the digital world! Strap on a Raspberry Pi with a DAC (keep Ductape withing reach) and install some software like Spotify Connect and gmediarender! The only thing missing is basically Volume Control and the option to open Internet Streams.

This is where ZPHR is intended to help out.
